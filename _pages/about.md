I am a first-year Master's student at the School of Electronics and Computer Engineering ([SECE](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/)), Peking University, fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ge Li](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1131/2009.htm). My research is centered on the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and spatial-temporal visual data. Specifically, I am passionate about exploring how the structured knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged to achieve a deeper, more semantic understanding of 3D scenes and dynamic videos.
