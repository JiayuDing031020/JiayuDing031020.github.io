## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a first-year Master's student at the School of Electronics and Computer Engineering ([SECE](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/)) at Peking University, where I have the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Ge Li](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1046/2658.htm).

My research operates at the intersection of <span style="color: #0077B6; font-weight: bold;">Large Language Models (LLMs)</span> and spatial-temporal data. My goal is to leverage the structured knowledge and reasoning of LLMs to unlock a deeper, more semantic understanding of complex <span style="color: #009688; font-weight: bold;">3D scenes</span> and <span style="color: #673AB7; font-weight: bold;">dynamic videos</span>. I am excited to contribute to building more capable and perceptive AI systems.
