## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a first-year Master's student at the School of Electronics and Computer Engineering ([SECE](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/)) at Peking University, where I have the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Ge Li](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1046/2658.htm).

My research operates at the intersection of <span style="color: #0077B6; font-weight: bold;">Large Language Models (LLMs)</span> and spatial-temporal data. My goal is to leverage the structured knowledge and reasoning of LLMs to unlock a deeper, more semantic understanding of complex <span style="color: #009688; font-weight: bold;">3D scenes</span> and <span style="color: #673AB7; font-weight: bold;">dynamic videos</span>. I am excited to contribute to building more capable and perceptive AI systems.


## 📝 Selected Publications

<small>(*: Equal Contribution, ✉: Corresponding Author)</small>

[1] **Polysemous Language Gaussian Splatting via Matching-based Mask Lifting** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22225)
<br>
**Jiayu Ding**, Xinpeng Liu, Zhiyi Pan, Shiqiang Long, Ge Li✉.
<br>
*Pioneered the transition of open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian understanding from geometric points to semantic objects, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks.*

[2] **Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection**
<br>
**Jiayu Ding**, Haoran Tang, Ge Li✉.
<br>
*Proposed the first open-vocabulary instruction ambiguity detection task for 3D scene understanding and developed a VLM-based framework that achieved SOTA results.*

[3] **A Dual-Layer Complex Network-Based Quantitative Flood Vulnerability Assessment Method of Transportation Systems** [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13060753)
<br>
**Jiayu Ding**, Yuewei Wang✉, Chaoyue Li. (*Land, 2024*)
<br>
*Developed a pioneering quantitative flood vulnerability assessment method for transportation systems based on a dual-layer complex network model.*

[4] **VISTA: Mitigating Semantic Inertia in Video-LLMs via Training-Free Dynamic Chain-of-Thought Routing** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.11830v3)
<br>
Hongbo Jin*, **Jiayu Ding***, Siyi Xie*, Guibo Luo, Ge Li✉.
<br>
*Identified the "semantic inertia" phenomenon in Video-LLMs and introduced VISTA, a training-free dynamic Chain-of-Thought routing framework. It effectively aligns perception with reasoning, significantly outperforming base models and rivaling larger closed-source models.*

[5] **TIR-Flow: Active Video Search and Reasoning with Frozen VLMs**
<br>
Hongbo Jin*, Siyi Xie*, **Jiayu Ding***, Kuanwei Lin, Ge Li✉.
<br>
*Integrated a System-2-like active visual exploration paradigm into Video-LLMs, significantly enhancing long-video understanding via a training-free dynamic evidence search and reasoning process.*
