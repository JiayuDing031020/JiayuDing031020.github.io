## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a first-year Master's student at the School of Electronics and Computer Engineering ([SECE](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/)) at Peking University, where I have the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Ge Li](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1046/2658.htm).

My research operates at the intersection of <span style="color: #0077B6; font-weight: bold;">Large Language Models (LLMs)</span> and spatial-temporal data. My goal is to leverage the structured knowledge and reasoning of LLMs to unlock a deeper, more semantic understanding of complex <span style="color: #009688; font-weight: bold;">3D scenes</span> and <span style="color: #673AB7; font-weight: bold;">dynamic videos</span>. I am excited to contribute to building more capable and perceptive AI systems.


## 📝 Selected Publications

<small>(*: Equal Contribution, ✉: Corresponding Author)</small>

[1] **Polysemous Language Gaussian Splatting via Matching-based Mask Lifting** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22225)
<br>
**Jiayu Ding**, Xinpeng Liu, Zhiyi Pan, Shiqiang Long, Ge Li✉.
<br>
*The first to elevate the understanding primitive of open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian Splatting from geometric points to semantic objects, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.*

[2] **Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05991v1)
<br>
**Jiayu Ding**, Haoran Tang, Ge Li✉.
<br>
*The first to introduce the task of open-vocabulary instruction ambiguity detection in 3D scene understanding, establishing state-of-the-art results via a novel VLM-based 3D reasoning framework.*

[3] **A Dual-Layer Complex Network-Based Quantitative Flood Vulnerability Assessment Method of Transportation Systems** [[Paper]](https://doi.org/10.3390/land13060753)
<br>
**Jiayu Ding**, Yuewei Wang✉, Chaoyue Li. (*Land, 2024*)
<br>
*The first to apply a dual-layer complex network model to quantitatively assess the flood vulnerability of transportation systems.*

[4] **VISTA: Mitigating Semantic Inertia in Video-LLMs via Training-Free Dynamic Chain-of-Thought Routing** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.11830v3)
<br>
Hongbo Jin\*, **Jiayu Ding**\*, Siyi Xie\*, Guibo Luo, Ge Li✉.
<br>
*The first to identify "Semantic Inertia" in Video-LLMs where visual evidence is suppressed. By proposing VISTA (a training-free dynamic Chain-of-Thought routing framework), it effectively aligns perception with logic, surpassing base models and rivaling larger proprietary models.*

[5] **TIR-Flow: Active Video Search and Reasoning with Frozen VLMs** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06176)
<br>
Hongbo Jin\*, Siyi Xie\*, **Jiayu Ding**\*, Kuanwei Lin, Ge Li.
<br>
*Proposes TIR-Flow, a training-free framework that enables frozen VLMs to perform "System-2" active visual search and reasoning, achieving significant gains (+10.5% on Egoschema) without any parameter updates.*
