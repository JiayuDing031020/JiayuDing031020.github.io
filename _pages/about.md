## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a first-year Master's student at the School of Electronics and Computer Engineering ([SECE](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/)), Peking University, fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ge Li](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1046/2658.htm). 

My research is centered on the intersection of <span style="color: #0077B6; font-weight: bold;">Large Language Models (LLMs)</span> and spatial-temporal visual data. Specifically, I am passionate about exploring how the structured knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged to achieve a deeper, more semantic understanding of <span style="color: #009688; font-weight: bold;">3D scenes</span> and <span style="color: #673AB7; font-weight: bold;">dynamic videos</span>.
